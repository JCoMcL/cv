Made with a **static-site-generator** called {{< a "https://gohugo.io/" >}}

This CV was, in part, a way to evaluate Hugo and delve deeper in CSS and HTML.

It fetches colors and repository statistics using the **REST APIs** of Github and Gitlab to generate the bar-graphs and badges. The stacked-bar-graphs below each project are visualizations of which languages and technologies were used. The concept and colors per-language were borrowed from Github's implementation.

The style and layout are of my own design, written from scratch so that this CV can also demonstrate my **web-development** and **design** abilities
