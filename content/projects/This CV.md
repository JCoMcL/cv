Made with a **static-site-generator** called {{< a "https://gohugo.io/" "Hugo" >}}, in part, to evaluate Hugo and delve deeper in web tecnologies. This CV fetches colors and repository statistics using the **REST APIs** of Github and Gitlab to generate the bar-graphs and badges for each project; the same ones you'd see on their respective project pages.

The style and layout are of my own design, written from scratch so that this CV can also demonstrate my **web-development** and **design** abilities
