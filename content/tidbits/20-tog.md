Tog is a **non-profit** collective of makers and hackers. Since I joined in 2018, I've taught others how to use the **CNC**, **3D-printer**, and **laser-cutter**, helped take apart and move the space to its new home in Inchicore, and volunteered at several **Repair Cafes**, where I helped visitors repair their furniture and electronics and such.
