Tog is a **non-profit** collective of makers and hackers. I've been an active member since 2018. I've often **mentored others** in use of the **CNC**, **3D-printer**, and **laser-cutter**, I helped take apart and move the space to its new home in Inchicore, and volunteered at several **Repair Cafes**, where I helped visitors repair their furniture and electronics and such.
