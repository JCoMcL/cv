*Computer Applications* was far more **holistic** and **modern** than a typical Computer Science course, and maintained a strong emphasis on current **industry demands**. Alongside the CS classics (**compilers**, **automata**, **calc.**, etc.) I learned things like **dev-ops**, **refactoring**, **critical-thinking**, and **communication**, and had actual **work placement** as a programmer.
