A modern and holistic course with a particular emphasis on supporting current **industry demands**. It incorporates subjects such as **dev-ops**, **refactoring**, **critical-thinking**, and **communication** alongside the Computer Science classics. This course included a 3-month **work placement** as a programmer where I worked on optimization of the CI/CD pipelines and advocated for and implemented the automation of release notes.
