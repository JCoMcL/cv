Tog is a non-profit collective of makers and hackers. Since I joined in 2018, I've taught others how to use the CNC, 3D-printer, and laser-cutter, helped take apart and move the space to its new home in Inchicore, and volunteered at several Repair Cafes, where I helped visitors repair their furniture, electronics, etc.
