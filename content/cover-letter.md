# Cover Letter
To the Hiring Manager.
I am excited to apply for the Infrastructure Software Developer position with your team. Although my professional experience is limited, my enthusiasm for automation and quick learning align perfectly with the role, and I am passionate about DevOps as a career path.
Automation is central to how I work. I'm very comfortable at the command-line and use it daily. I have gained a solid grasp of Linux and the UNIX shell, and know how to write shell scripts that are clean, performant, and don’t fail on edge-cases.
I have hands-on experience with IaC tools like Ansible and NixOS from managing my home server deployments. I have a good nose for finding the appropriate technologies to solve specific problems and am not shy about rolling my own when it’s clearly necessary. I am also quite a good programmer.
My CV itself is a representation of how I like to solve problems, and a demonstration of my ability to do so. It uses Markdown, CSV, and YAML files, along with data retrieved from the web, and renders into HTML and CSS.
Thank you for considering my application. I hope you look favourably on my application and I look forward to discussing how my passion for automation and learning can contribute to your team.
Yours sincerely,
Jordan Conway McLaughlin.
